        Dear Colleagues
    </p>
    <p>
        To date, the DQSP team has not received the information requested from you and you have not contacted them with regard to the request to indicate that you anticipated any difficulty in achieving the date to provide the information as requested.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is now urgent that this Freedom of Information request - [FOI_Ref] is progressed and I would be grateful therefore if you would:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Provide the information as requested by [Date] as below :
            <ul>
                <li style="white-space: pre-line">
                    <pre> [Information]</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            OR If the information cannot be provided because the Trust does not 'hold' the information requested, please advise if this is the case (under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, we (the Trust) are legally required to 'confirm or deny' if we hold the information requested).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please contact me as soon as possible if you have any queries in regard to this request or if there is any anticipated difficulty in achieving the ‘timescale’ to provide the information requested under the Freedom of Information Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for your continuing assistance and support in all Freedom of Information matters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regards,
